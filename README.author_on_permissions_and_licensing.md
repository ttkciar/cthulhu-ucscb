Huh, I have a link to a google zip file containing the old source code. It's 30+ years old, and I guarantee it's horrible code. https://<REDACTED>

TTK Ciar:
Thank you, sir!!
Do you have any preference/guidance on how little or much you would like this shared? Given my druthers, I'd put it up on GitHub, with full credit given to yourself, but won't do anything without your permission.

Jason Abbott:
If you want to put any of the collective commons copylefts on it, feel free. I give it to the world, so whichever one of the public share copyrights you're most happy with would be good enough for me. Again, I have no idea if a game can use many of those names (I understand all the names are free for literature, but Chaosium might own the rights to the game versions of the names). Feel free to mention that I was the original other, and I'll be happy. There will be a lot of work to port it anywhere.
